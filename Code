###uploading a .jpg as a tensor in pytorch


from skimage.transform import resize
from skimage.color import rgb2gray
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import torch
import imageio

###Loading image from .jpg file
picture = imageio.imread("C:/Users/longw/Documents/neuralnets/WristFracture/Train/Fracture/1 Male (A View).jpg")
print("NumPy: ", type(picture))
print("Shape of Array: ", picture.shape)
print("dtype of Array: ", picture.dtype)

##showing the pic as an array of rgb values
print(picture)

##resize to fit the NN
picture = resize(picture, (585,255), mode='constant', anti_aliasing=True)
print(picture)

##show the image to check the results
plt.imshow(picture,cmap="gray")
plt.show()

##turn it to greyscale

picture = rgb2gray(picture)
print(picture)


##show the grey image

plt.imshow(picture,cmap="gray")
plt.show()


##convert the array to a tensor
Tensor = torch.tensor(picture)
print(Tensor)
print(Tensor.shape)

##flatten to use as an input in a NN
Tensor = Tensor.flatten()
print(Tensor)
print(Tensor.shape)
